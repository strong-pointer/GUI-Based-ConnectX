# GUI-Based-ConnectX
This is the GUI-based version of my Connect-X game!
__________________________
Just as a heads up, since it uses Java Swing for the GUI, it only works on Windows machines as far as I can tell.

This program has the same functionality as my [Text-Based ConnectX](https://github.com/strong-pointer/TextBased-ConnectX) program, so for more information, please navigate to that repository.<br>
The number of players, gameboard size, and number of connections are available to be chosen by the user.
